Linux Architecture

HARDWARE <- KERNEL <- SHELL <- USER
kernel is the core of the operating system, acting as the bridge between hardware and software.
It manages all the essential low-level functions of the computer, like memory management, process scheduling, and device interaction.
The kernel loads into memory during startup and remains there until the system shuts down.
