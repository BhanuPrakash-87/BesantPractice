-------------------
Linux Architecture
-------------------
HARDWARE <- KERNEL <- SHELL <- USER
kernel is the core of the operating system, acting as the bridge between hardware and software.
It manages all the essential low-level functions of the computer, like memory management, process scheduling, and device interaction.
The kernel loads into memory during startup and remains there until the system shuts down.

------------
File System
------------
etc -> user configuration, dev -> drivers, bin -> binary scripts, lib -> library files

--------------------------------------------------
Install Linux environment in windows using Ubuntu
--------------------------------------------------
Go to windows search bar and search for “turn windows features on or off” option and select the option.
scroll down and select the option “windows Subsystem for Linux” and "Virtual Machine Platform" and click ok.
Restart system.

once the system is restarted , open cmd prompt and type "bash"
Bash, short for "Bourne Again SHell", is a powerful command-line interpreter and scripting language.
Bash provides a command-line interface (CLI), allowing users to interact with the Linux system by typing commands in a terminal.

Open the installed "Ubuntu",
If there is an error, update wsl (wsl --update)
WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), is a feature in Windows that allows you to run a Linux environment directly on your Windows machine.

Note it asks for user name and password for the user and it also automatically cretes the root account.
